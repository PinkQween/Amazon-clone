# Amaon clone

This is a clone of the amaon website with help from [Clever Programer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z6eRoagmz4&list=PLJfzZCO0xwHnWJBLP51fAoeJk1sRJe8fy) This is created using yarn and redux using libaries such as [react-router-dom](https://yarnpkg.com/package/react-router-dom), [styled-components](https://yarnpkg.com/package/styled-components), [@stripe/react-stripe-js](https://yarnpkg.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and more!

## Getting setup

To get started with this project go to the root folder and install components using

### `yarn install`

Then go to the functions folder then install those components using

### `npm install`

now all the components are installed and now you want to start the backend using

### `firebase emulators:start`

Now your running the backend to the Amazon clone and to strt up the frontend cd back into the root folder and run

### `yarn start`

This will start up the front end to the project and it should all be working localy, to setup outside your computer it's a bit more complex and you need to do your own research but make sure in the src folder in axios.js is the correct address

## Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
